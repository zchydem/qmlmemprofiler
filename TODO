- stop using QVector to store locations
- snapshot MallocStats on each location, store statistics on the topmost item on
  the stack
- thread safety
- investigate alternatives to malloc_usable_size. perhaps we ought to use magic
  to poke a size_t into each allocation for book-keeping purposes? can we get at
  glibc's allocation size easily?
